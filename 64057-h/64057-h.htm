<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Lady Huggins</span> in her original draft
of the obituary notice of my sister
Agnes, which appeared in the <i>Astrophysical
Journal</i>, included some
words of personal appreciation and
of reference to her family which
were omitted from the copy sent
for publication, as being, possibly,
somewhat beyond the scope of a
purely scientific journal. At my
request Lady Huggins has consented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
to the full original draft,
with a few additions, being published
for private circulation. She
has also, to my great gratification,
and entirely on her own initiative,
taken this opportunity of adding an
appreciation of my elder sister.</p>

<p>My sisters&#8217; acquaintance with
Lady Huggins commenced only
after they had been some time
permanently resident in London;
and for the accuracy of the statements
relating to their earlier lives
I am alone responsible. Their
father had died before the period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
of which Lady Huggins speaks from
personal knowledge; and perhaps it
is fit that I should supplement what
she says as to the influence of family
life upon the characters and careers
of my sisters by mentioning a few
facts connected with my father.
Although a classical scholar of
Trinity College, Dublin, his interests
were for the most part scientific.
In our earliest years his recreation
was chemistry, the consequential
odours of which used to excite the
wrath of our Irish servants. Later
a &#8220;big telescope&#8221; (4 inch aperture)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
was mounted in the garden, and we
children were occasionally treated
to a glimpse of Saturn&#8217;s rings, or
Jupiter&#8217;s satellites. In an age before
railways and telegraphs had reached
the remote parts of Ireland and
before clocks were &#8220;synchronised
with Greenwich,&#8221; the local time
would have gone &#8220;all agley&#8221; had it
not been for my father&#8217;s observations
with his &#8220;orthochronograph.&#8221;
These trivial things show that it was
in an environment of scientific suggestion
that our early lives were
passed; and to me, at all events, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
father&#8217;s influence was more than
suggestion, for to his painstaking
teaching I have to attribute any
little successes which I subsequently
achieved.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to express
to Lady Huggins my thanks in
fitting terms, for to thank implies
a service; and her work has been
not a service to me, but a labour
of love for those whose simple lives
she records. Still I may say that
I am deeply gratified by this finished
product of her pen, and that I
rejoice that she should have conceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
the idea of writing this Appreciation,
thereby enabling me to
place it before the eyes of many
friends.</p>

<p>I have to thank Director Frost
of the Yerkes Observatory for his
permission to reprint that part
of the &#8220;Appreciation&#8221; which has
already appeared.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AGNES MARY CLERKE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Agnes Mary Clerke</span> was born on
February 10, 1842, at Skibbereen,
a small country town in a remote
part of the County Cork. Her
father was John William Clerke;
and her mother was a sister of the
late Lord Justice Deasy.</p>

<p>Constitutionally delicate, Agnes
Clerke from her earliest years, as
so often is to be noticed in cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
of frail health, found her chief
delight in literary study and in
music. From quiet talks often
enjoyed with her in her later life,
it was clear that the thoughtfulness
of Agnes Clerke, and her
liking for probing difficult problems,
must have developed early.</p>

<p>This is not the place for enlarging
upon the family influences of
her home life, but it should be
said that these were truly fostering,
and that she was a devoted
and loving daughter, to whom the
parental sympathy, strongly given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
on both sides, was at once inspiration
and joy. Mrs. Clerke was a
remarkable woman, with rare powers
of insight and of capacity for love.
Her conversational powers were of
a high order, as was her musical
ability. Those privileged to be present
at her afternoon gatherings will
not easily forget their pleasures;
and intimate friends will long remember
the charms of her music.
Her rendering of old Irish airs on
Ireland&#8217;s national instrument&mdash;the
harp&mdash;was delightful; and so indeed
was her piano-playing. She told me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
one day near the close of her life,
when near her eightieth birthday,
that she practised on her instruments
<i>every day</i>. This was interesting; and
showed that power of persevering
work&mdash;even under the natural disabilities
of age&mdash;which was a marked
feature in her daughter Agnes.</p>

<p>The bust, a photograph of which
is here reproduced, was executed in
Rome when Mrs. Clerke was about
fifty years of age.</p>

<p>In considering the fostering influences
of Agnes Clerke&#8217;s home life,
that of her only brother, Aubrey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
St. John Clerke, should be mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Clerke won the first gold
medal of Trinity College, Dublin,
in Mathematics at his Degree examination
in 1865, and was awarded
a studentship of &pound;100 a year for
seven years&mdash;the highest honour
obtainable at the Degree examination.
He also won the second gold
medal conferred by the University
for Experimental and Natural
Science.</p>

<p>Mr. Clerke has told me&mdash;what
indeed I always believed&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
although not professing to be
a mathematician, his sister&#8217;s perception
of mathematical truth was
singularly clear; and I feel sure
that her brother&#8217;s mathematical
powers and knowledge of Natural
Science were a great advantage to
her, for the helpfulness of thorough
sympathy is very great. In her
later life she took lessons in mathematics,
and expatiated to me on
the pleasure she felt in them. Not
that she aimed at making herself
a mathematician; she was too wise
to so err. Her object was simply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
to go far enough to enable her to
do better her own particular work.
No one that I have known&mdash;man
or woman&mdash;better understood that
the half may be better than the
whole; that the art of doing, consists,
greatly, in&mdash;<i>not</i> doing. She
could renounce. And in these days
great renunciation is necessary if
useful work is to be done.</p>

<p>In 1861 the Clerke family moved
to Dublin, and in 1863 to Queenstown.
The winters of 1867 and of
1868 were spent at Rome; those of
1871 and 1872 at Naples; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
next four winters at Florence&mdash;the
summers of 1874-76 being passed at
the Bagni di Lucca. Both sisters
profited to the full from this sojourn
in Italy, as their subsequent writings
show; but Agnes at Florence
worked specially hard, reading constantly
in the Public Library there,
and always, I believe, with one
great object before her.</p>

<p>It is a question of much interest
to examine into the early leanings
and aspirations of those who distinguish
themselves later, and Agnes
Clerke early determined her life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
work. Before leaving Skibbereen,
about the age of fifteen, she had
clearly before her the intention of
writing a history of Astronomy,
and it is thought, had actually
written a few chapters. Her first
article accepted for the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, is in harmony with the
above facts.</p>

<p>Agnes Clerke&#8217;s first wish to examine
into Science generally, was
roused by the perusal of <i>Joyce&#8217;s
Scientific Dialogues</i>; but as regards
Astronomy, Sir John Herschel&#8217;s
<i>Outlines</i> was her earliest guide&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
I can imagine how much this
really great book was to her, from
my own early use of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well do I remember reading an
article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for
October 1880, on &#8220;The Chemistry
of the Stars.&#8221; I admired it much:
I wondered who had written it, for
it seemed to me to be unlike the
work of any one then known in the
scientific world. Five years later I
solved my puzzle, for in 1885 appeared
the <i>History of Astronomy
in the Nineteenth Century</i>; and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
had not looked far into it before
I exclaimed: &#8220;Now I know who
wrote that article in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after&mdash;dining at a house
where to dine was always to share
in a feast of reason and flow of
soul&mdash;and sitting between our distinguished
and kindly host Sir
William Bowman, and Sir Robert
Ball, Sir Robert and I exchanged
ideas about the new <i>History of
Astronomy</i>, and about its author,
the new &#8220;Unknown.&#8221; With all
his own acuteness, Sir Robert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
showed that the writer could not
be a practical astronomer. But I
was delighted to find that my admiration
for the <i>History</i> was fully
shared by him, and that his praise
of it was very warm.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I entered upon
a friendship, and upon a companionship
in Astronomy, which have been
among my best pleasures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Agnes Clerke&#8217;s literary life may
be said to have begun in 1877
with the acceptance of her article
&#8220;Copernicus in Italy,&#8221; by Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Reeve, then editor of the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, who recognised the
value of his new contributor and
kept her at work. The number of
her contributions to the <i>Edinburgh</i>
is fifty; and they are all of a high
order.</p>

<p>Agnes Clerke, with her family,
returned to England in 1877, and
settled in London. With the publication
of the <i>History of Astronomy</i>
in 1885 may be said to have begun
her astronomical life.</p>

<p>She read systematically, and cultivated
personal relations with a wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
circle of astronomical workers, in
person, or by correspondence. I
consider that these relations had
much to do with the success of her
work. Her sympathies were so
keen, her interest so warm, her
longing for further truth so intense,&mdash;that
every one liked to offer her
all they could!</p>

<p>In 1890 appeared her second book,
<i>The System of the Stars</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Observatory</i> for December
1890 contains an article by me on
this work. A review, in the strict
sense of the term, it was not, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
there was much in the book which,
for obvious reasons, I could not
discuss without becoming controversial.
But upon one important
question I spoke strongly; and I
venture now to recall and re-urge
the position I then tried to expound.
Briefly it is this. The progress of
Science and the growth of its literature
during the last quarter of a
century has been so enormous, that
a new order of worker is imperatively
called for; and I hailed in
Agnes Clerke an admirable example
of such a worker, devoting herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
to Astronomy, which is at once the
oldest and, in its new developments,
the youngest of the Sciences&mdash;the
science which Poincar&eacute; has lately
so eloquently declared has given
the conception of <i>law</i> to all the
others.</p>

<p>I ventured to sketch what should
be the qualifications and aims of
such workers; and the years which
have gone by since 1890 have but
deepened my conviction that there
is a splendid and ever-growing field&mdash;even
now white unto harvest&mdash;ready
for these special workers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Their mission is to collect, collate,
correlate, and digest the mass of
observations and papers&mdash;to chronicle,
in short, on one hand; and on the
other, to discuss and suggest, and
to expound: that is, to prepare
material for experts, and at the
same time to inform and interest
the general public. There is urgent
need of better educated public
opinion in this country.</p>

<p>That such a mission may be a
splendid and fruitful one has been
shown by Agnes Clerke; what careful
preparation it requires, and how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
much it demands of those who
would enter upon it, her career
also shows.</p>

<p>The immense increase in astronomical
literature is hardly realised
except by those engaged in dealing
with it. To give but one instance&mdash;&#8220;The
Annual Index of Astronomical
Literature for 1905,&#8221; published under
the auspices of the <i>Astronomische
Gesellschaft</i>, contains over two
thousand references, collated from
three hundred separate publications.</p>

<p>The strain of such work as I am
indicating is great indeed, involving,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
as it should, the power of holding
loose in the mind, so to speak, an
immense mass of facts, and also a
power of rapidly associating or dissociating
them as work and discovery
may suggest.</p>

<p>In one of her latest works, <i>Modern
Cosmogonies</i>, Agnes Clerke herself
dwelt upon this strain. &#8220;Year by
year,&#8221; she says (p. 160), &#8220;details
accumulate, and the strain of keeping
them under mental command
becomes heavier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pathetic words! written&mdash;almost
in blood! For not long before had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
been published her last large work,
<i>Problems in Astrophysics</i>; a work she
feared she could not live to complete&mdash;a
work which at times she
was only able to toil at for half-hour
periods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All through her life Agnes Clerke
was a student. Lectures and Friday
Evening Discourses at the Royal
Institution which bore upon her
work she was careful to attend.
A three months&#8217; visit to Sir David
and Lady Gill at the Cape in
1888 gave her some Observatory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
opportunities which increased her
power of clearly realising the records
of observatory and laboratory
work. Sir George Baden-Powell
invited her to accompany his yachting
party to Novaya Zemlya for
the solar eclipse of August 1896.
When I expressed very strongly
my regret that she had declined
this invitation (chiefly I now know
because she feared she might be
prevented from keeping literary engagements
absolutely to time), she
surprised me a week later with an
earnest request that she and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
should form a little expedition of
two, and try what <i>we</i> could see.
She had divined an unspoken
longing of mine, and I cannot
refrain from recording the unselfish
love that would fain have
gratified me. But it could not be.</p>

<p>She was awarded in 1892 the
Actonian Prize of one hundred
guineas for her works on Astronomy,
by the Royal Institution; and in
1901 was commissioned by the
Managers to write the first Essay
under the Hodgkins Trust, on Low
Temperature Research at the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Institution by Professor Sir James
Dewar from 1893-1900.</p>

<p>In 1903 she received the distinction
of being elected an Hon.
Member of the Royal Astronomical
Society&mdash;an honour and title held
previously only by Mrs. Somerville,
Caroline Herschel, and Ann
Sheepshanks. I may perhaps be
permitted to say that my own
deep gratification in my share of
this great honour conferred on us
by the Society was heightened by
receiving it with Agnes Clerke.</p>

<p>She was a frequent attendant at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the meetings of both the Royal
Astronomical Society and the British
Astronomical Association, and always
an interested one. Occasionally she
spoke; but she had no liking for
speaking in public, nor indeed was
she well suited for it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A complete list of Agnes Clerke&#8217;s
papers it would be difficult to compile.
They were, in truth, innumerable.
Her articles on astronomers
for the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>&mdash;out of the sixty-six
volumes which constitute this great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
work there are only eleven to which
she did not contribute,&mdash;articles for
the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, and
for other encyclop&aelig;dias were many,
and all of them were models of
painstaking inquiry and of clear,
concise statement. The more important
of these, that on Laplace in
the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, for instance,
are of lasting interest and
value.</p>

<p>Her larger works are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>History of Astronomy in the
Nineteenth Century</i> (4 editions).</p>

<p><i>The System of the Stars.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span><i>Familiar Studies in Homer.</i></p>

<p><i>The Herschels and Modern Astronomy.</i></p>

<p><i>Concise History of Astronomy.</i></p>

<p><i>Modern Cosmogonies.</i></p>

<p><i>Problems in Astrophysics.</i></p></div>

<p>I venture to think that the
<i>History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth
Century</i> is the most important
of her works. It is admirable in its
completeness of references, its wide
inclusiveness, and in its lucidity. It
deserves to live, and it assuredly will
live&mdash;the invaluable continuation of
Grant&#8217;s fine work. <i>The System of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the Stars</i> and the <i>Problems in Astrophysics</i>
are works of a different order.
Treasuries of knowledge and of
suggestion they certainly are.</p>

<p>The <i>Homeric Studies</i>, except in
one chapter, are not specially astronomical;
but they are evidence of
width of culture and of wide intellectual
interest, and are full of
delightful touches of wit and of
humour.</p>

<p><i>The Herschels</i> is excellent and
agreeable biographical reading. Three
lives are vividly set forth in little
more than two hundred octavo pages.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>It seems to me a mistake to regard
Agnes Clerke&#8217;s smaller works as of
less importance than her larger ones.</p>

<p>I have said that I consider the
<i>History</i> her greatest work. But, in
some respects, I venture to think
that her greatest achievement is
<i>Modern Cosmogonies</i>. I claim for
this book that it is not only a
history, but a work of philosophical
thinking and of imaginative insight
of a very high order.</p>

<p>Its small size is an accident. It
is a work essentially great. In these
superbly brilliant sketches Agnes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Clerke&#8217;s style is at its best. Usually,
it suffers from effort; the lucidity
may be laboured, and the perpetual
antithesis may sometimes be wearying.
I have spoken of her laboriousness
in study and in work, and
can adorn the tale by relating what
was surely a very remarkable performance.
She had at the time
no knowledge of Portuguese, but as
part of her preparation for an article
in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> &#8220;Don
Sebastian and his Personators,&#8221; in six
weeks she not only acquired considerable
knowledge of the language,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
but read the whole of the <i>Lusiad</i>
in the original!</p>

<p><i>Le Style, c&#8217;est l&#8217;homme</i>; is it surprising
that the physical efforts she
made I fear only too often, tended
to render her writing laboured at
times?</p>

<p>But the writing in <i>Modern Cosmogonies</i>,
good as it is, is a small
matter compared with the masterly
grasp of, I may say, all things, and
of their inter-relations, which the
work reveals. And where else is
shown in recent philosophical writing
such vision and faculty divine for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
seizing and pointing out the reasonable
spiritual clues, set in what we
call Nature,&mdash;clues helping to sustainment
of soul in the midst of the
majestic mysteries surrounding us?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No sketch of Agnes Clerke would
be complete without reference to her
love of music. To her music was in
the highest sense of the term a
recreation. She turned to it for very
life. Her piano-playing was truly
musicianly, and her repertory was
large. Perhaps on the whole, her
playing was at its best in rendering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Chopin. As an accompanist
she excelled. Her teachers were,&mdash;in
Dublin, Miss Flynn; in Florence,
Buonamici.</p>

<p>I record here the complete story
of her introduction to Liszt. One
moonlight night in the spring of
either 1868 or 1869, Mrs. Clerke
and her daughters rambling about
Rome were fascinated by such
piano-playing as they had never
before heard, and they stopped outside
the open window of the villa
and listened spellbound until the
unknown Maestro had finished and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
came to the window to look out
upon the night. Then the enthusiasm
of the hearers overcame conventionality,
and they gave free
expression to their admiration; and
the fifth act of the little drama was
that Liszt invited his listeners to
enter, promising to play again on
condition that Agnes first played
for him, which I believe she did.</p>

<p>Remarkable as were the intellectual
powers of Agnes Clerke, her
moral endowments were equally so.
It was a question we frequently debated&mdash;the
influence of character on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
work; and as I write the memory of
certain talks is hauntingly present.
As is the heart, is the work. The best
work is and must be associated with
lofty character. It was so with
Agnes Clerke. No purer, loftier,
and yet sweetly unselfish and human
soul has lived. She was so incapable
of meanness that she even incurred
danger as a historian in crediting
too readily all workers with her own
high ideals.</p>

<p>As a friend and companion she
was faithful and true, and full of
charm; and without her the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
to those who had her friendship
seems darkened and empty.</p>

<p>But her mission, I must believe,
was accomplished. For twenty years
she had been to modern Astronomy
an admirable historian, and had kept
before working astronomers clear
charts, so to speak, of what was
being done, and of what should
and might be done. In so doing
she rendered splendid service, and
inaugurated a kind of work which
must be more and more needed&mdash;a
kind of work which not only advances
Astronomy, but promotes a universal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
brotherhood and co-operation, golden
indeed.</p>

<p>Agnes Clerke&#8217;s death comes as a
shock to many. A cold&mdash;I fear not
sufficiently nursed at first&mdash;led to
pneumonia and complications, and in
spite of all that devoted love and
skill could do, she passed gently to
the next life, peaceful and fully
conscious almost to the last, on the
morning of January 20, 1907.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ELLEN MARY CLERKE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ellen Mary Clerke</span>, the only sister
of Agnes Clerke, whose interest in
Astronomy was also keen, was born
at Skibbereen on September 26,
1840. She shared her sister&#8217;s life,
and her devotion to her contributed
not a little to the perfect fulfilment
of its mission.</p>

<p>Acutely sensitive to the beautiful,
and with a rare capacity for enthusiasms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Ellen Clerke was first of all
a poet. But she was much besides.
She was an accomplished linguist;
and the years she spent in Italy were
devoted to such study of Italian
literature as enabled her later to do
excellent original work in connection
with it. An admirable article by
her in the <i>Dublin Review</i> for October
1879, on &#8220;The Age of Dante in the
Florentine Chronicles,&#8221; well deserves
remembrance, so full is it of the
illumination of wide reading and
of careful thinking. Alas! only
too many articles by her have passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
into magazine oblivion. Some of
these were written in foreign tongues&mdash;a
sure proof of mastery of them.
For instance, in 1869 she published
a pamphlet in German with the title
<i>Das Judenthum in der Musik</i>; while,
besides many articles and reviews in
Italian in the Florentine periodicals,
she published in one of these a serial
story in Italian, called <i>Sotto le Sette
Stelle</i>. She had also a knowledge
of Arabic by no means inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Her interest in geographical science
was not generally known; but she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
was a valued member of the Manchester
Geographical Society, and
contributed to its Journal.</p>

<p>As regards Astronomy, she has
left useful evidence of her warm interest
in the subject in two excellent
popular monographs, and in various
articles.</p>

<p>A list of Ellen Clerke&#8217;s works is
given at the end of this sketch, but
special mention must be made of her
work as a journalist. Her friends
might regret&mdash;as I did for one&mdash;that
so much of her time was thus
spent; but, after all, journalism is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
what the journalist makes it; and it
cannot be denied that it is a great
and increasing power in our midst.</p>

<p>Assuredly Ellen Clerke always
used her opportunities as a journalist
for noble ends. For the last twenty
years of her life she wrote a weekly
leader for the <i>Tablet</i>,&mdash;usually on
subjects connected with the Church
abroad; and on several occasions
during the temporary absence of the
Editor she filled his place at his
request.</p>

<p>Many of her literary articles contributed
to various periodicals were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
critical, and that she was a generous
and encouraging as well as a capable
critic the following facts pleasingly
illustrate.</p>

<p>In the <i>Westminster Review</i> for
October 1878 she had an article on
&#8220;The later Novels of Berthold Auerbach.&#8221;
It met the eye of the novelist,
and he directed to be sent to her a
copy of his <i>Landolin von Reutersh&ouml;fen</i>,
inscribed: &#8220;To the Author of
the article in the <i>Westminster Review</i>,
October 1878, with kind regards of
Berthold Auerbach. Berlin, Nov.
14, 1878.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>It is singular that the poems of
Ellen Clerke, published in 1881,
should not have attracted more
attention. The volume is now, I
believe, almost, if not entirely, out of
print; and partly on this account,
partly because of its subject and of
its beauty, I give here one of the
poems.</p>


<p class="center">NIGHT&#8217;S SOLILOQUY</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Who calls me dark? for do I not display</div>
<div class="indent">Wonders that else man&#8217;s eye would never see?</div>
<div class="verse">Waste in the blank and blinding glare of Day,</div>
<div class="indent">The heavens bud forth their glories but to me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Is it not mine to pile their crystal cup,</div>
<div class="indent">Drain&#8217;d by the thirsty sun and void by day,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
<div class="verse">Brimful of living gems, profuse heap&#8217;d up,</div>
<div class="indent">The bounteous largesse of my royal way?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mine to call o&#8217;er at dusk the roll of heav&#8217;n,</div>
<div class="indent">Array its glittering files in order due?</div>
<div class="verse">To beckon forth the lurking star of Even,</div>
<div class="indent">And bid the constellations start to view?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The wandering planets to their paths recall,</div>
<div class="indent">And summon to the muster tenant spheres,</div>
<div class="verse">Till thronging to my standard one and all,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent">To hurl them broadcast as wing&#8217;d meteors forth?</div>
<div class="verse">Strew sheaves of fiery arrows on my way,</div>
<div class="indent">And blazon my dark spaces in the north?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Is not a crown of lightnings mine to wear,</div>
<div class="indent">When polar flames suffuse my skies with splendour?</div>
<div class="verse">And mine the homage with the sun to share,</div>
<div class="indent">His vagrant vassals rush through space to render?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
<div class="verse">Who calls me secret? are not hidden things,</div>
<div class="indent">Reveal&#8217;d to science when with piercing sight</div>
<div class="verse">She looks beneath the shadow of my wings,</div>
<div class="indent">To fathom space and sound the infinite?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In plasmic light do I not bid her trace</div>
<div class="indent">Germs from creation&#8217;s dawn maturing slow?</div>
<div class="verse">And in each filmy chaos drown&#8217;d in space</div>
<div class="indent">See suns and systems yet in embryo?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Miss Clerke specially enjoyed
romantic subjects; and the sea and
shipping appealed to her strongly.
Her ballad on <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>
legend is one of the finest treatments
of the subject I have met with, and it
is to be regretted that it is not better
known, for it would lend itself well
both to the reciter and to the musician.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>The volume of poems gave evidence
of a special gift which in later years
the author cultivated with great
success,&mdash;that of verse translation.
Her delightful and valuable book,
<i>Fable and Song in Italy</i>, is illustrated
throughout with her own
versions; and although I do not
pretend to have compared each
version with its original, I venture
to say that the translations are, as a
whole, wonderfully faithful, and that
when the number of them, and the
variety of subjects and of measures,
are considered, the verse part alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
of the work is a notable achievement.
The prose part is more than a mere
setting; it is full of touches of illuminating
thought, and many little-known
facts are brought together
suggestively, while many of the
descriptive passages are wonderfully
vivid. In Dr. Garnett&#8217;s <i>History of
Italian Literature</i> the English versions
selected by him from Boiardo
and some other poets were by Ellen
Clerke.</p>

<p>Ellen Clerke&#8217;s literary style was
lighter and more spontaneous than
her sister&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>Like her sister she was highly
musical, and her instrument was the
guitar. A pupil of Madame Pratten,
she had through the practice of many
years acquired a mastery of the instrument
unusual in an amateur,
managing it with great skill, and
arranging for it many an accompaniment.
To the last almost, her singing
to the guitar was full of charm;
and in earlier years when the sisters
sang together to her guitar accompaniment
the performance was delightful.</p>

<p>A devoted and exemplary Catholic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Ellen Clerke was untiring in her zeal
for all good works. Unselfish and
loving, she was a devoted daughter,
sister, and friend. Fonder of society
than her sister, it was perhaps natural
that she did not pursue literary work
in the same persistent way. And it
fell in with her sociability that
she pulled a good oar and enjoyed
riding.</p>

<p>These sisters were lovely and
pleasant in their lives, and in death
they were but little divided. Ellen
Clerke died after a short illness on
March 2, 1906.</p>

<p>The monographs on Jupiter and

in a way which places them above
the ordinary popularisers.</p>

<p>The article above referred to in
the <i>Observatory</i> was the outcome of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
her Arabic reading, and showed that
there can be little doubt that the
variability of Algol had been noticed
by the Arabian astronomers.</p>
